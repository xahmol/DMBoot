## 1. Overview
([Back to contents](#contents))

The Ultimate Command Interface (UCI) is a memory-mapped hardware interface exposed by the Ultimate II+, Ultimate II+ L, and Ultimate 64 cartridges. It provides the C64 CPU with access to the cartridge's file system, network stack, real-time clock, and drive emulation control, all through a small set of I/O registers at `$DF1C–$DF1F`.

The library is split into four files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `include/ultimate_common_lib.h/.c` | Hardware register access, protocol engine, detection |
| `include/ultimate_dos_lib.h/.c` | File I/O, directory navigation, REU transfer, drive control, system info |
| `include/ultimate_time_lib.h/.c` | Real-time clock read/write |
| `include/ultimate_network_lib.h/.c` | TCP/UDP sockets, line-by-line stream reading |

All library files are included in the Oscar64 build via `#pragma compile(...)` directives in their respective headers. No explicit inclusion in the Makefile is needed.

---

## 2. Hardware Registers
([Back to contents](#contents))

The UCI exposes four registers mapped at `$DF1C–$DF1F`. The same two addresses serve different purposes for reads and writes.

### Read Registers (`struct UII_READ` at `$DF1C`)

| Offset | Name | Address | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| +0 | `status` | `$DF1C` | Status register — bitmask of current UCI state |
| +1 | `id` | `$DF1D` | Identity register — `$C9` when UCI is present |
| +2 | `respdata` | `$DF1E` | Response data FIFO — read one byte at a time |
| +3 | `statusdata` | `$DF1F` | Status string FIFO — read one byte at a time |

### Write Registers (`struct UII_WRITE` at `$DF1C`)

| Offset | Name | Address | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| +0 | `control` | `$DF1C` | Control register — write bits to issue commands |
| +1 | `cmddata` | `$DF1D` | Command data — write bytes to build a command packet |

### Status Register Bit Definitions

| Bit | Mask | Meaning when set |
|-----|------|-----------------|
| 0 | `0x01` | Acknowledge active |
| 1 | `0x02` | Acknowledge cleared (ACK done) |
| 2 | `0x04` | Error flag |
| 4 | `0x10` | Command busy |
| 5 | `0x20` | Command accepted / idle |
| 6 | `0x40` | Status data available in `statusdata` FIFO |
| 7 | `0x80` | Response data available in `respdata` FIFO |

Bits 4 and 5 together indicate state: both clear = idle, bit 5 set only = busy.

### Control Register Bit Definitions

| Bit | Mask | Action when written |
|-----|------|---------------------|
| 0 | `0x01` | `PUSH_CMD` — push the command packet and execute |
| 1 | `0x02` | `ACK` — acknowledge response and release UCI |
| 2 | `0x04` | `ABORT` — abort the current operation |
| 3 | `0x08` | `CLR_ERROR` — clear the error flag |

### Queue Sizes

| Queue | Size | Constant |
|-------|------|----------|
| Command data queue | 512 bytes (actual hardware: 896) | `DATA_QUEUE_SZ` |
| Status string queue | 256 bytes | `STATUS_QUEUE_SZ` |

The `DATA_QUEUE_SZ` constant is set conservatively to 512 to limit RAM usage. The actual UCI hardware queue is 896 bytes. Increase `DATA_QUEUE_SZ` in `ultimate_common_lib.h` if larger transfers are needed (e.g. for networking).

### Firmware 3.15+ Unlock Sequence

| Register | Address | Write value |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `uci_unlock1` | `$D038` | `0xAB` |
| `uci_unlock2` | `$D036` | `0xCD` |

Writing `0xAB` to `$D038` then `0xCD` to `$D036`, in that order, enables the UCI I/O mapping from the cartridge itself on firmware 3.15+, without needing "Command Interface" turned on beforehand in the Ultimate's own menu. **Not present in the official Register API PDF as of this writing** — confirmed directly by Gideon Zweijtzer and verified empirically against real Ultimate 64-II hardware (a single write to `$D038` alone, matching the visible `U64Config::unlock_irq()` handler in the firmware source, does **not** work — both writes are required). Harmless on older firmware/bitstreams: nothing else in this project uses `$D030`–`$D03F`, and if the unlock isn't implemented, the writes are simply ignored and `uii_detect()` keeps failing exactly as before. See `uii_enable()` / `uii_wait_for_uci()` in §7.

---

## 3. Global Variables and Buffers
([Back to contents](#contents))

All global variables are defined in `ultimate_common_lib.c` and declared `extern` in `ultimate_common_lib.h`.

### `uii_data[]` — Response Data Buffer

```c
char uii_data[DATA_QUEUE_SZ + 1];   // 513 bytes
```

After any command that returns data, `uii_data` holds the raw response bytes. The number of bytes stored is returned by `uii_readdata()`. The buffer is always null-terminated.

**Caution:** `uii_data` is overwritten by every call to `uii_readdata()`. Copy needed values immediately after reading.

### `uii_status[]` — Status String Buffer

```c
char uii_status[STATUS_QUEUE_SZ + 1];   // 257 bytes
```

After every completed command, `uii_status` holds the status string from the UCI. Typical values: `"00,OK"`, `"83,NO SUCH DIRECTORY"`. Use the `UII_SUCCESS` macro to check the status rather than inspecting the string directly.

### `uii_target` — Active Target

```c
char uii_target;   // default: TARGET_DOS1
```

The target that will receive the next command. Set by `uii_settarget()`. Most file and directory functions set this automatically and restore it on return.

### `uii_devinfo[]` — Drive Information Array

```c
struct DevInfo uii_devinfo[4];
```

Populated by `uii_parse_deviceinfo()`. Indices:

| Index | Device |
|-------|--------|
| 0 | Drive A (first emulated 1541/1571/1581) |
| 1 | Drive B (second emulated drive) |
| 2 | SoftIEC device |
| 3 | Soft printer |

### `struct DevInfo` Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `exist` | char | 0 = not present, 1 = present |
| `type` | char | Drive type: `0x00`=1541, `0x01`=1571, `0x02`=1581, `0x0F`=SoftIEC, `0x50`=Printer |
| `power` | char | 0 = powered off, 1 = powered on |
| `id` | char | IEC bus device ID (typically 8–11) |

### `uii_data_index` / `uii_data_len` — Stream Read Cursors

```c
unsigned uii_data_index;
unsigned uii_data_len;
```

Used internally by the network streaming functions (`uii_tcp_nextchar`, `uii_tcp_nextline`). Reset by `uii_reset_uiidata()` and `uii_tcp_emptybuffer()`.

### `UII_SUCCESS` Macro

```c
#define UII_SUCCESS (uii_status[0] == '0' && uii_status[1] == '0')
```

Returns true (non-zero) when the last command completed with status `"00,..."`. Always check this after any operation that can fail. The first two characters of the status string are the numeric error code; `"00"` means success.

| `CTRL_CMD_SET_PALETTE_COLOR` | `0x53` | Set a single palette color (test-merge branch only) |
| `CTRL_CMD_RESET_PALETTE` | `0x54` | Restore the default VIC palette (test-merge branch only) |

`CTRL_CMD_READ_RTC` (`0x02`) is defined here for completeness but not currently dispatched anywhere in firmware's `control_target.cc` command switch — treat it as reserved/unimplemented rather than a working command. This project's own time sync uses NTP over the network (`uii_udpconnect()`), not the Ultimate's onboard RTC.

### SoftIEC Command IDs (firmware 3.15+)

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| `SOFTIEC_CMD_ADD_PARTITION` | `0x20` | Add (or overwrite, if the index is already in use) a SoftIEC partition |
| `SOFTIEC_CMD_DEL_PARTITION` | `0x21` | Remove a SoftIEC partition by index |

Firmware 3.15 added CMD-HD-style partitions to SoftIEC. The firmware also defines `SOFTIEC_CMD_GET_FATNAME` (`0x22`) and `SOFTIEC_CMD_GET_IECNAME` (`0x23`) — per-name, on-demand conversions between a real filename and its classic-DOS-truncated form, not bulk-listing commands — not wrapped in this library, since the project doesn't need them yet. Also not wrapped: `LOAD_SU`/`LOAD_EX`/`SAVE`/`OPEN`/`CLOSE`/`CHKIN`/`CHKOUT` (`0x10`-`0x16`), a full alternate UCI-native file-I/O path for the Ultimate's own SoftIEC drive that bypasses the classic IEC bus entirely — deliberately deferred, since this project's IEC-mode browsing must also work on real 1541/1571/1581/SD2IEC hardware, which that path can't reach. Selecting *which* partition is current is a classic DOS `CP<n>` command over the regular IEC command channel, not a UCI command — there is no UCI command to change the current partition, only to add/remove one (see `src/core.c`'s `iec_select_partition()`, outside this library's scope since it doesn't use the UCI protocol).

### Network Command IDs

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NET_CMD_GET_INTERFACE_COUNT` | `0x02` | Get number of network interfaces |
| `NET_CMD_GET_NETADDR` | `0x04` | Get an interface's MAC address |
| `NET_CMD_GET_IP_ADDRESS` | `0x05` | Get device IP address |
| `NET_CMD_SET_IPADDR` | `0x06` | Set an interface's IP configuration |
| `NET_CMD_TCP_SOCKET_CONNECT` | `0x07` | Open TCP connection |
| `NET_CMD_UDP_SOCKET_CONNECT` | `0x08` | Open UDP connection |
| `NET_CMD_SOCKET_CLOSE` | `0x09` | Close socket |
| `NET_CMD_SOCKET_READ` | `0x10` | Read from socket |
| `NET_CMD_SOCKET_WRITE` | `0x11` | Write to socket |

`NET_CMD_SET_INTERFACE` (`0x03`) is intentionally not defined: its handler in firmware's `network_target.cc` is compiled out, so it currently does nothing on real hardware. Not wrapped until firmware re-enables it.

The `TCP_LISTENER_START`/`STOP`/`GET_LISTENER_STATE`/`GET_LISTENER_SOCKET` commands (`0x12`-`0x15`) and their wrapper functions/state constants were removed from this library (2026-09-06): current firmware's network target dispatch has no case above `WRITE_SOCKET` (`0x11`) at all, so these were unreachable dead code inherited from an older version of the upstream xlar54 library, unused anywhere in this project. This project's own NTP time sync (`uii_udpconnect()`) is a plain client-initiated UDP socket and never needed a listener.

### File Open Attribute Flags

These flags combine to specify how a file is opened:

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `FA_READ` | `0x01` | Open for reading |
| `FA_WRITE` | `0x02` | Open for writing (file must exist) |
| `FA_CREATE_NEW` | `0x04` | Create new file (clears to 0 bytes) |
| `FA_CREATE_ALWAYS` | `0x08` | Create; overwrite if file exists |

**Common combinations:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0x01` | Read existing file |
| `0x06` | Create new file for writing (`FA_WRITE` \| `FA_CREATE_NEW`) |
| `0x0E` | Write, creating or overwriting (`FA_WRITE` \| `FA_CREATE_NEW` \| `FA_CREATE_ALWAYS`) |

---

## 5. Protocol Flow
([Back to contents](#contents))

Every UCI operation follows the same four-step sequence. High-level functions in the library perform all four steps internally — you do not need to call them manually unless building custom commands.

```
1. uii_sendcommand(cmd, length)
      │  Writes target ID + opcode + arguments to $DF1D
      │  Waits for UCI idle, then sets PUSH_CMD bit in control register
      └─ Retries if error bit is set

2. uii_readdata()              ← call only if command returns data
      │  Polls status register bit 7 (data available)
      │  Drains respdata FIFO into uii_data[]
      └─ Returns number of bytes read

3. uii_readstatus()
      │  Polls status register bit 6 (status data available)
      │  Drains statusdata FIFO into uii_status[]
      └─ Returns number of bytes read

4. uii_accept()
      │  Sets ACK bit in control register
      └─ Waits for acknowledgement to clear
```

**For streaming commands** (`uii_read_file`, `uii_get_dir`): the firmware returns data in multiple packets. After calling the command, drain data in a loop using `uii_isdataavailable()` / `uii_ismoredataavailable()` / `uii_readdata()` / `uii_accept()`:

```c
uii_read_file(length);
while (uii_isdataavailable() || uii_ismoredataavailable())
{
    bytes = uii_readdata();
    uii_accept();
    // process uii_data[0..bytes-1]
}
```

---

## 6. Status Codes and Error Handling
([Back to contents](#contents))

Every command places a null-terminated status string in `uii_status[]` after completion. The format is `"NN,MESSAGE"` where `NN` is a two-digit decimal error code.

### Common Status Strings

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `"00,OK"` | Success |
| `"00,ok"` | Success (alternate casing) |
| `"01,DIRECTORY EMPTY"` | Directory opened but no entries |
| `"02,REQUEST TRUNCATED"` | Transfer shorter than requested (EOF) |
| `"82,FILE NOT FOUND"` | `uii_mount_disk` — named file not found in the current directory (confirmed on hardware; not in the official command doc, which only lists `"89"`/`"90"` for this command) |
| `"83,NO SUCH DIRECTORY"` | `uii_change_dir` — directory not found |
| `"84,NO FILE TO CLOSE"` | `uii_close_file` — no open file |
| `"85,NO FILE OPEN"` | Read/write called without open file |
| `"86,CAN'T READ DIRECTORY"` | `uii_open_dir` — directory unreadable |
| `"88,NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE"` | `uii_file_info` — no file open |
| `"88,FILE NOT FOUND"` | `uii_file_stat` — named file not found |
| `"89,NOT A DISK IMAGE"` | `uii_mount_disk` — file is not a disk image. Also confirmed returned by `uii_open_file()` (generic read-open, attrib `0x01`) when called on a disk image file — the firmware rejects a plain read-open of disk images outright; they can only be accessed via `uii_mount_disk()`, not opened generically |
| `"90,DRIVE NOT PRESENT"` | `uii_mount_disk`/`uii_unmount_disk` — drive ID not found |
| `"92,..."` | `uii_file_stat` — confirmed returned on hardware when stat'ing a disk image file; exact meaning undocumented (not in the official command reference this manual is based on). Avoid using `uii_file_stat()`/`uii_open_file()` as a generic existence probe for disk image files — use `uii_mount_disk()`/`uii_change_dir()` directly instead, since those are the only commands confirmed to handle disk images predictably |
| `"98,FUNCTION PROHIBITED"` | `uii_set_time` — setting disabled in Ultimate config |
| `"ACCESS DENIED"` | Write to read-only file |

### Checking Success

Always use `UII_SUCCESS` immediately after a command completes:

```c
uii_change_dir(mypath);
if (!UII_SUCCESS)
{
    // handle error: uii_status contains the message
    errorexit("");
}
```

For operations inside a loop (streaming reads), check after each `uii_accept()`:

```c
while (uii_isdataavailable() || uii_ismoredataavailable())
{
    bytesread = uii_readdata();
    uii_accept();
    if (!UII_SUCCESS) { /* handle error */ break; }
    // process bytesread bytes in uii_data[]
}
```

---

## 7. Core Functions
([Back to contents](#contents))

Defined in `ultimate_common_lib.h` / `ultimate_common_lib.c`.

---

### `uii_detect`

```c
char uii_detect(void);
```

**Purpose:** Check whether the UCI hardware is present.

**Returns:** `1` if detected (identity register at `$DF1D` reads `0xC9`), `0` if not present.

**Side effects:** Calls `uii_abort()` to reset the UCI if detected.

**Example:**
```c
if (!uii_detect())
{
    // No Ultimate cartridge present — exit
    fc3_exit();
}
```

---

### `uii_enable`

```c
void uii_enable(void);
```

**Purpose:** Send the firmware 3.15+ UCI unlock sequence (see §2), enabling UCI from the cartridge without needing it turned on beforehand in the Ultimate's own menu.

**Notes:** Fire-and-forget — does not poll or wait. Harmless on older firmware (see §2). Normally called via `uii_wait_for_uci()` rather than directly.

---

### `uii_wait_for_uci`

```c
char uii_wait_for_uci(char timeout_seconds);
```

**Purpose:** Send the firmware 3.15+ unlock sequence, then poll `uii_detect()` for up to `timeout_seconds` seconds (CIA1 TOD-based), so UCI comes up even on firmware where it wasn't enabled in the menu.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `timeout_seconds` | Maximum seconds to poll before giving up |

**Returns:** `1` if UCI was detected within the timeout, `0` otherwise.

**Notes:** At cold autostart the C64 starts faster than the Ultimate firmware boots, leaving the UCI status register in an undefined state that would make `uii_sendcommand()` spin forever — this is why the wait loop is needed before issuing any other UCI command. Use this in place of a bare `uii_detect()` call at startup.

**Example:**
```c
if (!uii_wait_for_uci(10))
{
    // Still not detected after 10 seconds
    fc3_exit();
}
```

---

### `uii_settarget`

```c
void uii_settarget(char id);
```

**Purpose:** Set the target subsystem for subsequent commands.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | Target ID: `TARGET_DOS1` (0x01), `TARGET_DOS2` (0x02), `TARGET_NETWORK` (0x03), `TARGET_CONTROL` (0x04) |

**Notes:** Most high-level functions call `uii_settarget()` automatically. Use this directly only when building custom commands or when switching targets manually. The network functions save and restore `uii_target` around their calls.

---

### `uii_sendcommand`

```c
void uii_sendcommand(char *bytes, unsigned count);
```

**Purpose:** Send a raw command packet to the UCI. The first byte of `bytes` is overwritten with the current `uii_target` value.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `bytes` | Command buffer; `bytes[0]` will be set to `uii_target`, `bytes[1]` is the command opcode, remaining bytes are arguments |
| `count` | Total number of bytes to send, including the target and opcode bytes |

**Notes:** Waits for the UCI to be idle before sending. Retries if the error bit is set. This is the lowest-level send function; all higher-level functions call it internally.

---

### `uii_accept`

```c
void uii_accept(void);
```

**Purpose:** Acknowledge completion of a UCI response and release the UCI for the next command. Must be called after draining all response data and status.

**Notes:** Sets the ACK bit in the control register and waits for the UCI to clear it.

---

### `uii_readdata`

```c
unsigned uii_readdata(void);
```

**Purpose:** Drain the UCI response data FIFO into `uii_data[]`.

**Returns:** Number of bytes read (0 if no data available).

**Notes:** Reads bytes one at a time from `respdata` (`$DF1E`) while the data-available bit (bit 7 of status) is set. Always null-terminates `uii_data`. Stops at `DATA_QUEUE_SZ` bytes; excess data is discarded.

---

### `uii_readstatus`

```c
unsigned uii_readstatus(void);
```

**Purpose:** Drain the UCI status FIFO into `uii_status[]`.

**Returns:** Number of status bytes read.

**Notes:** Reads bytes one at a time from `statusdata` (`$DF1F`) while the status-data-available bit (bit 6) is set. Always null-terminates `uii_status`. After this call, `UII_SUCCESS` is valid.

---

### `uii_isdataavailable`

```c
char uii_isdataavailable(void);
```

**Purpose:** Check whether the UCI data FIFO has bytes to read (status bit 7).

**Returns:** `1` if data is available, `0` if not.

---

### `uii_ismoredataavailable`

```c
char uii_ismoredataavailable(void);
```

**Purpose:** Check whether the UCI has more data in a multi-packet transfer (status bits 4 and 5 both set).

**Returns:** `1` if more packets follow, `0` if this is the last packet.

**Notes:** Used in streaming loops alongside `uii_isdataavailable()`. A transfer is fully complete when both return 0.

---

### `uii_isstatusdataavailable`

```c
char uii_isstatusdataavailable(void);
```

**Purpose:** Check whether the UCI status FIFO has bytes to read (status bit 6).

**Returns:** `1` if status data is available, `0` if not.

---

### `uii_abort`

```c
void uii_abort(void);
```

**Purpose:** Abort the current UCI operation by setting the ABORT bit in the control register.

**Notes:** Does not wait for confirmation. Use when an operation must be cancelled, or to reset the UCI to a known state.

### `uii_identify`

```c
void uii_identify(void);
```

**Purpose:** Query the UCI firmware identification string (e.g. `"ULTIMATE-II DOS V1.4"`).

**Data returned:** Null-terminated identification string in `uii_data[]`.

**Status:** Always `"00,OK"`.

---

### `uii_echo`

```c
void uii_echo(void);
```

**Purpose:** Test command — sends the command packet and receives it back as data.

**Data returned:** Echo of the command in `uii_data[]`.

**Status:** Always `"00,OK"`.

---

### `uii_freeze`

```c
void uii_freeze(void);
```

**Purpose:** Trigger a freeze (cartridge button press equivalent) via the control interface.

---

### `uii_add_partition`

```c
void uii_add_partition(char index, const char *name, const char *path);
```

**Purpose:** Add a SoftIEC partition (firmware 3.15+), or overwrite an existing one's name/path if `index` is already in use.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `index` | Partition number, 1–255 |
| `name` | Partition display name |
| `path` | Root path the partition points to, e.g. `"/"` |

**Wire format:** `$05 $20 <index> "NAME:/path"` — colon-separated name/path in a single command packet, per `software/io/command_interface/softiec_target.cc`'s `cmd_add_partition()` in `github.com/GideonZ/1541ultimate`.

**Notes:** Does not select the new partition as current — that requires the classic DOS `CP<n>` command over the IEC channel, outside this library's scope (see `src/core.c`'s `iec_select_partition()`). Overwriting an existing partition number silently replaces its name/path, so choose an index the user is unlikely to have configured themselves via the Ultimate's own partition-management GUI if the intent is to avoid clobbering their setup.

---

### `uii_del_partition`

```c
void uii_del_partition(char index);
```

**Purpose:** Remove a SoftIEC partition (firmware 3.15+).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `index` | Partition number to remove |

**Wire format:** `$05 $21 <index>` — see `softiec_target.cc`'s `cmd_del_partition()`.

**Notes:** No confirmation or "does this partition still look like ours" check happens in this library — callers are responsible for confirming with the user before calling this on a partition they didn't just create, since it deletes the partition mapping unconditionally.

---

---

### `uii_setpalette`

```c
void uii_setpalette(const char *rgb48);
```

**Purpose:** Replace the entire 16-color VIC palette. Firmware test-merge branch only.

## 8. DOS Functions — File Operations
([Back to contents](#contents))

Defined in `ultimate_dos_lib.h` / `ultimate_dos_lib.c`. All file operations act on `TARGET_DOS1` (drive A's file system). To operate on drive B's file system, call `uii_settarget(TARGET_DOS2)` before using these functions.

---

### `uii_open_file`

```c
void uii_open_file(char attrib, char *filename);
```

**Purpose:** Open a file on the current path.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `attrib` | Open mode flags (see §4 for values) |
| `filename` | File name to open (null-terminated) |

**Common `attrib` values:**

| Value | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `0x01` | Read existing file |
| `0x06` | Create new file for writing |
| `0x0E` | Write, creating or overwriting |

**Status:** `"00,OK"` on success, or a filesystem error.

**Notes:** Only one file may be open at a time per target. The filename does not need to be null-terminated inside the UCI packet (length is inferred from command size), but the C string passed must be null-terminated for `strlen()` to work correctly.

---

### `uii_close_file`

```c
void uii_close_file(void);
```

**Purpose:** Close the currently open file.

**Status:** `"00,OK"` or `"84,NO FILE TO CLOSE"`.

---

### `uii_write_file`

```c
void uii_write_file(char *data, unsigned length);
```

**Purpose:** Write `length` bytes from `data` to the currently open file.

**Parameters:**

|-----------|-------------|
| `data` | Pointer to the data buffer to write |
| `length` | Number of bytes to write |

**Status:** `"00,OK"`, `"85,NO FILE OPEN"`, or `"ACCESS DENIED"`.

**Caution:** The total command packet size is `length + 4`. The UCI command queue is `DATA_QUEUE_SZ` (512) bytes, so `length` must not exceed `DATA_QUEUE_SZ - 4` = 508 bytes per call. For larger transfers, call in a loop. In practice, `SAVE_BUF_SIZE` (500) is used in this project to provide a safe margin.

---

### `uii_read_file`

```c
void uii_read_file(unsigned length);
```

**Purpose:** Request up to `length` bytes from the currently open file. Does **not** call `uii_readdata()` — you must drain the data in a loop.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `length` | Maximum bytes to read (encoded as 16-bit little-endian in the command) |

**Status:** Set in `uii_status[]` after draining all packets with `uii_readstatus()`.

**Notes:** The firmware returns data in packets of up to 512 bytes each. Use `uii_isdataavailable()` and `uii_ismoredataavailable()` to drain all packets:

```c
uii_read_file(sizeof(buf));
while (uii_isdataavailable() || uii_ismoredataavailable())
{
    bytes = uii_readdata();
    uii_accept();
    // copy uii_data[0..bytes-1] to destination
}
```

---

### `uii_seek_file`

```c
void uii_seek_file(char posL, char posML, char posMH, char posH);

**Example — seek to byte 1024:**
```c
uii_seek_file(0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00);
```

---

### `uii_file_info`

```c
void uii_file_info(void);
```

**Purpose:** Get metadata about the currently open file.

**Data returned in `uii_data[]`:**

|-----------|-------------|
| `filename` | Name of the file to delete |

**Status:** `"00,OK"` or a filesystem error.

**Notes:** Used in this project before `uii_open_file(..., 0x06, ...)` because overwrite mode (`0x0E`) was found to be unreliable on some firmware versions. The safe pattern is delete then create new.

### `uii_socketwritechar`

```c
void uii_socketwritechar(char socketid, char one_char);
```

**Purpose:** Write a single byte to a socket.

---

### `uii_tcp_nextchar`

```c
char uii_tcp_nextchar(char socketid);
```

**Purpose:** Read the next byte from the TCP receive stream, refilling the buffer from the socket as needed.

**Returns:** Next byte, or `0` on end-of-stream.

**Notes:** Maintains internal `uii_data_index` and `uii_data_len` cursors. More efficient than calling `uii_socketread()` per byte for stream processing.

---

### `uii_tcp_nextline`

```c
unsigned uii_tcp_nextline(char socketid, char *result);
```

**Purpose:** Read the next line from the TCP stream (up to `\n`) into `result`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `socketid` | Socket ID |
| `result` | Buffer to store the line (caller must ensure sufficient size) |

**Returns:** `1` if a line was read, `0` on end-of-stream.

**Notes:** Strips `\r` characters. Returns PETSCII as-is (no case conversion).

---

### `uii_tcp_nextline_ascii`

```c
unsigned uii_tcp_nextline_ascii(char socketid, char *result);
```

**Purpose:** Read the next line with ASCII case conversion applied (uppercase ASCII → lowercase PETSCII and vice versa).

**Returns:** `1` if a line was read, `0` on end-of-stream.

---

### `uii_tcp_emptybuffer`

```c
void uii_tcp_emptybuffer(void);
```

**Purpose:** Reset the `uii_data_index` cursor to 0, discarding any buffered but unread data.

---

### `uii_reset_uiidata`

```c
void uii_reset_uiidata(void);
```

**Purpose:** Zero out `uii_data[]` and `uii_status[]` and reset the stream cursors. Use to ensure a clean state between unrelated operations.

## 14. Typical Usage Patterns
([Back to contents](#contents))

### Read a File

```c
uii_change_dir("/usb0/config/");
uii_open_file(0x01, "myfile.cfg");
if (UII_SUCCESS)
{
    uii_read_file(sizeof(buf));
    while (uii_isdataavailable() || uii_ismoredataavailable())
    {
        unsigned n = uii_readdata();
        uii_accept();
        // process n bytes from uii_data[0..n-1]
    }
    uii_close_file();
}
```

### Write a File

```c
uii_change_dir("/usb0/config/");
uii_delete_file("myfile.cfg");           // delete first (overwrite unreliable)
uii_open_file(0x06, "myfile.cfg");       // create new
if (UII_SUCCESS)
{
    uii_write_file((char *)&mydata, sizeof(mydata));
    uii_close_file();
}
```

### Write a Large File in Chunks

```c
long pos = 0;
long end = total_size;
char buf[500];

uii_open_file(0x06, "large.dat");
while (pos < end)
{
    unsigned chunk = (end - pos < 500) ? (end - pos) : 500;
    // fill buf[0..chunk-1] from source
    uii_write_file(buf, chunk);
    pos += chunk;
}
uii_close_file();
```

### Browse a Directory

```c
uii_open_dir();
if (!UII_SUCCESS) { /* error */ }

uii_get_dir();
while (uii_isdataavailable())
{
    uii_readdata();
    uii_accept();
    char attr = uii_data[0];
    char *name = uii_data + 1;
    char is_dir = (attr & 0x10) != 0;
    // process name and is_dir
}
```

### Mount a Disk Image and Wait for Drive Ready

```c
if (!uii_parse_deviceinfo()) { errorexit(""); }
if (!uii_devinfo[0].power)
{
    uii_enable_drive_a();
    delay(2);                 // allow drive to spin up
}
uii_change_dir("/usb0/games/");
uii_mount_disk(uii_devinfo[0].id, "game.d64");
if (!UII_SUCCESS) { errorexit(""); }
```

### Load REU from File

```c
uii_change_dir("/usb0/reu/");
uii_open_file(0x01, "myimage.reu");
if (UII_SUCCESS)
{
    uii_load_reu(2);          // 2 = 512 KB
    uii_close_file();
}
```

### NTP Time Sync via UDP

```c
char socketid;
char ntpbuf[48] = {0};
ntpbuf[0] = 0x1B;            // NTP request: LI=0, VN=3, Mode=3

socketid = uii_udpconnect("pool.ntp.org", 123);
if (UII_SUCCESS)
{
    uii_socketwrite(socketid, ntpbuf);  // send NTP request
    uii_socketread(socketid, 48);       // read NTP response
    // parse uii_data[2..49] for timestamp
    uii_socketclose(socketid);
}
```

### Detect and Print Connected Drives

```c
if (uii_parse_deviceinfo())
{
    char a;
    for (a = 0; a < 4; a++)
    {
        if (uii_devinfo[a].exist)
        {
            // uii_devinfo[a].id    = IEC device ID
            // uii_devinfo[a].type  = drive type
            // uii_devinfo[a].power = 0=off, 1=on
        }
    }
}
```
